The codes files are written in python:

1. astar_point.py
2. astar_rigid.py
3. dijkstra_point.py
4. disjkstra_rigid.py

The files will require numpy and matplotlib libraries installed

just run the code and give the required inputs.
The codes will ask for:
1.) user inputs in the form of start and goal points
2.) the programs for rigid bodies will ask for robot radius as well as clearance.
3.) the resolution is assumed as 1 by default. Told by professor in the lecture
4.) Map of the robot ans obstacle space will be shown in all cases however the path will be shown only in those cases where it has valid start and goal points
5.) the program will spit out errors such as invalid start and end points only after all the values asked by the program have been entered
